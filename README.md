PowerNex
========

PowerNex is a kernel written in the [D Programming Language](http://dlang.org/).
The goal is to have a whole OS written in D, where PowerNex powers the core.

The name PowerNex comes from the words `power` and `next`. A kernel to power the
next generation of hardware. (Please don't hate on the name, I came up with it
in 2011)

Building
--------
It uses my build system called [Wild](https://github.com/Vild/Wild)
It expects the wild binary to be located in the root directory of PowerNex, then
you just need to run `./build` to build.
